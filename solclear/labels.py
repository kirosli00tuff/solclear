"""Four-class detection labels from keyless sources — one label per mechanism.

Ported from MLCryptoEngine C.20. Never a binary: **hard_rug** from SolRPDS
liquidity aggregates (>= 99% of added liquidity later removed); **honeypot**
from GoPlus token-extension state; **soft_rug** and **slow_rug** are *not
labelable* from keyless sources and live in an explicit
``unlabeled_residual`` rather than being folded into a class they do not
belong to. The RugCheck ``rugged`` flag is discarded entirely — it returned
False on all four documented rugs tested in C.19 (see FINDINGS.md).

The honest minority is identified as **honest_candidate** — not hard-rug and
still Active — and is an *upper bound* on honesty: soft and slow rugs
contaminate it from above, which is exactly why it is named candidate.

The monotonic-authority inference lives here as code: a mint or freeze
authority can be revoked but never restored, so **present-now proves
present-at-launch** — a leak-free pre-event fact — while absent-now proves
nothing about when it went.
