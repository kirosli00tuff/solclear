"""Launch-window reconstruction: pre-event features and decontamination rules.

Ported from MLCryptoEngine C.21 with its ordering intact: everything here is a
pure function over transaction records so the leakage suite is wired **before
any real feature ever computes** — ``tests/test_leakage.py`` holds the window
guard, prefix invariance, and the planted-future canary as first-class tests,
and this module must stay green under them.

**The window: 1,800 seconds from first pool activity.** Justification, not
taste: C.20 measured hard-rug lifetimes at Q25 = 2.6 h and median = 2.55 d,
so a 30-minute window sits strictly before the label event for roughly nine
in ten hard rugs while remaining short enough to matter for avoidance — the
tool's decision point is "score at T0+30 min and act". Pools whose label
event falls **inside** the window are not clamped, not truncated, and not
quietly included: :func:`feature_window_end` refuses them with
:class:`WindowLeakError`, the caller counts them as excluded, and that count
is reported. A window extending past the label event is a leak regardless of
how the feature is named.

Decontamination rules, fixed before any data in the parent project: within
the insider set (creator plus wallets whose first funding came from the
creator), selling **>= 70% of window-end holdings within 72 h** of T0 is a
**soft rug**; reaching 70% only later but **within 30 days** is a **slow
rug**; otherwise the pool stays honest_candidate. The thresholds move only
by ADR.
